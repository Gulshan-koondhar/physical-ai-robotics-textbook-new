# ROS 2 Components

This chapter delves into the core components of ROS 2 that enable complex robotic systems: Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions, Parameters, and Launch Systems.

## Nodes

Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of ROS 2 applications. We'll cover:
- Node lifecycle management
- Creating nodes in Python and C++
- Node composition for efficiency
- Error handling and logging

## Topics

Topics enable asynchronous communication between nodes:
- Publisher-subscriber pattern
- Quality of Service (QoS) profiles
- Message types and custom messages
- Performance considerations

## Services

Services provide synchronous request-response communication:
- Service definitions and implementation
- Client-server patterns
- Error handling in services

## Actions

Actions handle long-running tasks with feedback:
- Goal, result, and feedback patterns
- Canceling and preemption
- Action clients and servers

## Parameters

Parameter management for configuration:
- Parameter declarations and types
- Dynamic parameter updates
- Parameter files and namespaces

## Launch Systems

Organizing complex systems:
- Launch files in XML and Python
- Conditional launching
- Command line arguments
- Integration with system services
