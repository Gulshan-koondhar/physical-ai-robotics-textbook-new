# URDF/Xacro Mastery

This chapter focuses on creating and managing robot descriptions using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) and Xacro (XML Macros) for efficient robot modeling.

## Understanding URDF

URDF is an XML format that describes robot models including:
- Kinematic chains
- Visual and collision geometry
- Inertial properties
- Joint limits and dynamics

## Introduction to Xacro

Xacro extends URDF with:
- Macros for reusable components
- Mathematical expressions
- Conditional statements
- Parameterization

## Building a 22-DoF Humanoid Model

This section walks through creating a complete humanoid model with:
- Torso and head
- Arms with shoulders, elbows, and wrists
- Legs with hips, knees, and ankles
- Proper kinematic chains and joint constraints

## Simulation Considerations

- Collision mesh optimization
- Inertial property calculation
- Transmission definitions for control
