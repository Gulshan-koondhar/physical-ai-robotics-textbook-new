# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of Physical AI and humanoid robotics that form the foundation for the rest of this textbook.

## Overview

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with embodied systems. Unlike traditional AI that operates in virtual environments, Physical AI must navigate the complexities of the real world, dealing with uncertainty, physics, and real-time constraints.

## Key Concepts

- Embodied cognition and the importance of physical interaction
- The role of simulation in robotics development
- Hardware-software co-design principles
- Safety considerations in humanoid robotics

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will understand:
- The fundamental differences between virtual and physical AI systems
- The challenges specific to humanoid robotics
- The ecosystem of tools and frameworks used in modern robotics
- The progression from simulation to real-world deployment

## Next Steps

This chapter sets the stage for Module 1, where we'll dive deep into ROS 2 - the middleware that enables communication between different components of a robotic system.
