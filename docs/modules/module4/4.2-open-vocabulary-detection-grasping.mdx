- Instance segmentation for grasping
- Performance vs. accuracy trade-offs
- Custom training procedures

## Grasping with MoveIt 2

- Grasp pose estimation
- Integration with MoveIt 2
- Collision avoidance during grasping
- Adaptive grasping strategies

## End-to-End Pipeline

- Detection to grasping workflow
- Real-time requirements
- Error handling and recovery
- Performance evaluation
