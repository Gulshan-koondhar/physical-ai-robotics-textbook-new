# Unity Rendering & ROS Connector

This chapter explores high-fidelity rendering using Unity and connecting it to ROS 2 for enhanced visualization.

## Unity Robotics Setup

- Installing Unity Robotics Hub
- ROS TCP Connector setup
- URDF Importer for Unity
- Simulation environment creation

## High-Fidelity Rendering

- Physically-based rendering (PBR)
- Realistic lighting and materials
- Post-processing effects
- Performance optimization

## ROS Integration

- Real-time communication via TCP
- Synchronization between simulators
- Sensor data visualization
- Control command transmission

## Use Cases
