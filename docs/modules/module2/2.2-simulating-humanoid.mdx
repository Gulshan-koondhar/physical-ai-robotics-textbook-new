# Simulating a Full Humanoid

This chapter focuses on bringing the humanoid robot to life in simulation using Gazebo, RViz2, and Foxglove Studio.

## Spawning the Humanoid

- Loading URDF models into Gazebo
- Initial pose and configuration
- Joint state publishing
- Robot state publishing

## Control Systems

- Position, velocity, and effort controllers
- Joint trajectory execution
- Balance and stability considerations
- Safety limits and constraints

## Visualization Tools

- RViz2 for robot state visualization
- Foxglove Studio for real-time data
- Custom visualization plugins
- Multi-view monitoring

## Sensor Integration

- Camera feeds and image processing
- IMU data interpretation
- Force/torque sensor feedback
- Multi-sensor fusion concepts
