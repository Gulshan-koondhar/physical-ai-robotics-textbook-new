# Chapter 15: Capstone – "Bring Me the Red Cup" Full Project

## Overview

This capstone project integrates all the concepts learned throughout the textbook into a single, comprehensive application. Your humanoid robot will be able to understand the voice command "Find the red cup, pick it up, and bring it to me" and execute it successfully.

## Project Requirements

- Voice command recognition using Whisper
- Natural language understanding with GPT-4o/Llama-3-70B
- Task and motion planning
- Open-vocabulary object detection (Grounding DINO + SAM)
- Grasping with MoveIt 2
- Navigation with Nav2
- Integration with your 20+ DoF humanoid model

## Implementation Steps

1. **Voice Command Processing**: Set up Whisper for speech-to-text conversion
2. **Language Understanding**: Parse the command to identify objects and actions
3. **Object Detection**: Use Grounding DINO + SAM to locate the red cup
4. **Grasping Planning**: Plan the grasp using MoveIt 2
5. **Navigation**: Use Nav2 to navigate to the object
6. **Execution**: Execute the complete task sequence

## Launch File

Create a single ROS 2 launch file that starts the entire system:

```xml
<launch>
  <!-- Voice recognition node -->
  <node name="whisper_node" pkg="voice_pkg" exec="whisper_node" />

  <!-- Language model node -->
  <node name="llm_node" pkg="llm_pkg" exec="llm_node" />

  <!-- Object detection node -->
  <node name="object_detection_node" pkg="detection_pkg" exec="object_detection_node" />

  <!-- Navigation stack -->
  <include file="$(find-pkg-share nav2_bringup)/launch/navigation_launch.py" />

  <!-- MoveIt 2 configuration -->
  <include file="$(find-pkg-share moveit_config)/launch/moveit.launch.py" />
</launch>
```

## Testing the System

To test the complete system:

1. Launch the full system: `ros2 launch capstone_project full_system.launch.py`
2. Issue the voice command: "Find the red cup, pick it up, and bring it to me"
3. Observe the robot's response and execution

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Object detection fails**: Ensure proper lighting conditions and camera calibration
- **Grasping fails**: Verify gripper calibration and object pose estimation
- **Navigation fails**: Check for obstacles and map accuracy

## Conclusion

This capstone project demonstrates the integration of all components learned in this textbook. Successfully completing this project confirms your mastery of Physical AI and humanoid robotics concepts.
