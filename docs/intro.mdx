# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the definitive, open-source, AI-powered textbook that enables any motivated learner with an RTX workstation (or cloud equivalent) and a Jetson kit to go from zero to a fully functional voice-controlled humanoid robot (simulated + real deployment) in one quarter.

## What You'll Learn

This comprehensive textbook covers four essential modules that will take you from basic robotics concepts to advanced AI-powered humanoid control:

1. **Module 1 – The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**: Master ROS 2 fundamentals from zero to advanced concepts including nodes, topics, services, actions, parameters, launch systems, Python rclpy, URDF/Xacro authoring for a 20+ DoF humanoid, ros2 bag, RViz2, and Foxglove Studio integration.

2. **Module 2 – The Digital Twin (Simulation)**: Build full physics simulation pipelines with Gazebo Harmonic + Ignition, sensor plugins (LiDAR, RealSense depth+RGB, IMU, force/torque), world building, Unity + ROS TCP Connector for high-fidelity rendering, and controlling humanoid robots in simulation.

3. **Module 3 – The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac Platform)**: Integrate NVIDIA Isaac Sim (Omniverse), Isaac ROS GEMs for hardware-accelerated perception (VSLAM, stereo, AprilTag, ESS disparity), Nav2 for bipedal locomotion, synthetic data generation with Replicator, and domain randomization.

4. **Module 4 – Vision-Language-Action (VLA) & Conversational Robotics**: Build end-to-end voice-to-action pipelines using Whisper, GPT-4o / Llama-3-70B, task & motion planning, open-vocabulary detection (Grounding DINO + SAM), grasping with MoveIt 2, and local deployment on Jetson Orin using TensorRT.

## The Ultimate Goal

By the end of this textbook, you will be able to run a single ROS 2 launch file that starts a simulated (or real) humanoid capable of understanding the voice command: **"Find the red cup, pick it up, and bring it to me"**

## How to Use This Textbook

This interactive textbook features:

- Step-by-step tutorials with hands-on exercises
- Interactive MDX content with runnable code examples
- Embedded RAG chatbot for instant technical assistance
- Dark mode for comfortable reading
- Full-text search capability
- PDF export functionality

Each module builds upon the previous one, but is designed to be as independent as possible so you can focus on the areas most relevant to your goals.

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- An RTX workstation or cloud equivalent for AI workloads
- A Jetson kit for real-world deployment (optional for simulation-only learning)
